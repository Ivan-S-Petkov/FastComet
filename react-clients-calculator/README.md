# Customer Calculator with animated circular progress bar 

The purpose of the app is to visualize the percentage of new customers over all customers. The user should input both input fields /"New Clients" and "All Clients" and upon their update the progress bar animation would be triggered. The "Submit" button would re-trigger the animation.
